# MIT App Inventor 

We'll be skipping the RPi GUI for now, You can check out how to download **Scratch** in your RPi in [This Category.](/docs/scratch-tut/scratch-introduction)

MIT App Inventor is a web application integrated development environment originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

## Introduction

The way you make something in the MIT App Inventor is kind of the same with **Scratch,** you use coding blocks. But in order to make an app look good, you still have to make a layout.

## Familiarize Yourself

The App Inventor has 2 separate tabs, and both of these are:
- The Designer
- The Block Editor

The Designer is basically where you add your components, and The Block Editor is where you give that component a purpose.

## Categories

Like in Scratch, both The Designer and The Block Editor consists of different categories where you can find the item you need.

### Designer
- User Interface
- Layout
- Media
- Drawing and Animation
- Maps
- Sensors
- Social
- Storage
- Connectivity
- LEGO® MINDSTORMS®
- Experimental

:::info

For your Formative Assessments, you have to make pretty basic apps, and you'll have to make use of some of the Designer blocks like **sensors,** though in your SA3, You have to use all of the things you learned to make an app that **should be** navigable, more info on that later.

:::

### Block Editor
Built-in
- Control
- Logic
- Math
- Text
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Colors
- Variables
- Procedures

## Live Testing

To see how your app actually looks like, go to the App Store/Play Store and search for **`MIT AI2 Companion`**.

### Set-up

:::caution

REMINDER: Your Phone and Laptop/PC **MUST BE** connected to the same internet.
<small>The App Inventor will automatically show you the app you are building, but
only if your computer (running App Inventor) and your device (running
the Companion) are connected to the same WiFi Network.</small>

Steps to Follow:
1. Make a new **Project**:

Projects -> Start New Project

:::info

If you've already made projects in the past, your screen should look like this:

:::

2. Go to:

Connect -> AI Companion.
You should see a modal pop up and give you 2 things: A **QR Code** and a **code.**

> **A dialog with a QR code will appear on your PC screen. On your device, launch the MIT Companion app just as you would do any app. Then click the “Scan QR code” button on the Companion, and scan the code in the App Inventor window.**
