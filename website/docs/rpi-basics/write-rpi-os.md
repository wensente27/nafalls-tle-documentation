# Writing the OS

The Raspberry Pi OS is the **Operating System** that manages the hardware and software on your RPi. You need to **install/write** the OS to the SD Card that is provided in your Robotics Kit.

## Installation of OS to SD Card

1. Connect your microSD card to your USB adaptor.

2. Connect your USB adaptor to your laptop/desktop.

3. Open the newly installed Raspberry Pi Imager App.

4. Click “CHOOSE OS” and select the Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit).

5. Click  “CHOOSE STORAGE” and select your SD card storage.

6. Click the “WRITE” button and wait for it to finish.

:::caution

If Windows tells you to format your USB, **Don't**.

:::

You should get a scren with the text **"Write Successful"**, You're good to go!

## Disclaimer

I won't be emphasizing on how to turn on the RPi with your TV anymore, you probably know that already. The next page will be about turning on the RPi **remotely**.
